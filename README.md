Code for an inteligence architeture project. It is coded in Java, the program program identifies objects through a camera and controls a dynamic structure that changes its shape depending on the position and number of objects. 
The code is not entirely mine, it is adapted from an existing coding challenge on image detection made by The Coding Train on youtube.
